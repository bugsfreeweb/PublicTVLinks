# PublicTVLinks
![PublicTVLinks](https://m3uchecker.netlify.app/img/logo.png)

Welcome to **PublicTVLinks**, a repository that provides a curated list of active TV streaming links in multiple formats. These files (`active_tv_links.m3u`, `active_tv_links.json`, `active_tv_links.txt`, and `active_tv_links`) are automatically updated once every 24 hours using a GitHub Actions workflow to ensure only working links are included.

## Files
- **`active_tv_links.m3u`**: An M3U playlist file containing active TV streams, categorized by genre (e.g., News, Sports, Movies), with channel names and logos.
- **`active_tv_links.json`**: A JSON file listing active TV streams with details like name, type (category from source or "Free Air TV"), URL, and logo image.
- **`active_tv_links.txt`**: A TXT file in M3U format, identical to `active_tv_links.m3u`.
- **`active_tv_links`**: A file without extension in JSON format, identical to `active_tv_links.json`.

## How It Works
- A private script fetches links from 30 public sources, verifies their activity with improved reliability (HEAD with GET fallback, retries, and broader status acceptance), and generates these output files.
- The process runs daily at 00:00 UTC via GitHub Actions, pushing updates to this public repository.
- Only links confirmed active (e.g., HTTP 200 or 206) are included, optimized for offline streaming compatibility.

## Usage
1. **Download**: Grab the latest files from the repository.
2. **M3U/TXT**: Use `active_tv_links.m3u` or `active_tv_links.txt` with media players like VLC, IPTV apps, or Smart TVs supporting M3U playlists.
3. **JSON/No-Ext**: Use `active_tv_links.json` or `active_tv_links` in custom applications or scripts needing structured data.
